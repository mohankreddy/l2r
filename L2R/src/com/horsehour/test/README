This is the guide to run the test codes.

DEARank algorithm contains two steps: construct
the weak ranker candidates, train and evaluate the 
trained ranking model. 

To run the test codes of DEARank algorithm, the
steps and needed parameters are summarized in 
list as follows:

I. Run com.horsehour.test.Test_WeakGenerator.java

Parameters:
(1). workspace
               directory of the data set that is computed 
               to construct weak ranker candidates

(2). type     
               type of derived DEA model, "O" for CCR-O, 
               "I" for CCR-I 

II. Run com.horsehour.test.Test_Eval.java

Parameters:
(1). workspace 
               directory of the data set that is computed 
               to construct weak ranker candidates

(2). storePredict 
               indicate whether the predictions are stored.
               In default, storePredict = false

(3). normalize
               indicate whether the data set should be norma-
               lized. In default, normalize = false. Elsewise,
               you can set one normalizer, such as 
               MaxNormalizer, SumNormalizer, ZScoreNormalizer

(4). trainMetric
               the metric used for training, including NDCG@k,
               DCG@k, MAP, MAPNDCG, Precision, ERR et al. 

(5). valiMetric
               the metric used for validation, it is the same
               as trainMetric in default

(6). testMetrics
               the metrics used for testing, they are
               NDCG@1, NDCG@2, ..., NDCG@10, and MAP
               in default.

(7). type    
               type of DEARank algorithm, "O" for DEARank-O, 
               "I" for DEARank-I

(8). niter
               positive number of iterations, e.g. niter = 200


NOTE: Before the running, you should download data sets from LETOR
      http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/beijing/projects/letor/
      then, copy the downloaded data set to the customized workspace
