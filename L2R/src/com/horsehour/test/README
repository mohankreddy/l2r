This is the guide to run the test codes.

To run the test codes of DEARank algorithm, the
steps and needed parameters are summarized in 
list as follows:

I. Run com.horsehour.test.Test_WeakGenerator.java

Parameters:
(1). workspace
			   directory of the data set that is computed 
			   to construct weak ranker candidates

(2). type     
               type of derived DEA model, O for O-CCR, 
               I for I-CCR 

II. Run com.horsehour.test.Test_Eval.java

Parameters:
(1). workspace 
			   directory of the data set that is computed 
			   to construct weak ranker candidates
				
(2). storePredict 
               indicate whether the predictions are stored.
               In default, storePredict = false

(3). normalize
               indicate whether the data set should be norma-
               lized. In default, normalize = false. Elsewise,
               you can set one normalizer, such as 
               MaxNormalizer, SumNormalizer, ZScoreNormalizer

(4). trainMetric
               the metric used for training, including NDCG@k,
               DCG@k, MAP, MAPNDCG, Precision, ERR et al. 
(5). valiMetric
               the metric used for validation, it is the same
               as trainMetric in default
               
(6). testMetrics
               the metrics used for testing, they are
               NDCG@1, NDCG@2, ..., NDCG@10, and MAP
               in default.
               
(7). type    
               type of DEARank algorithm, O for O-DEARank, 
               I for I-DEARank

(8). niter
               positive number of iterations, e.g. niter = 200


NOTE: Before the running, you should download data sets from LETOR
      http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/beijing/projects/letor/
      then, copy the downloaded data set to the customized workspace
